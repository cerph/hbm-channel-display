![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031544497127030844/1062215636631167066/image-7.png)

made for 1.12.2 (1.7.10 uses a different interface, gl)

- populates the channels at program startup
- ~2 second refresh delay
- made for reasim and won't work with a non-reasim boiler setup (easy to implement though)
- i put in arbitrary values for the alerts, ur gonna want to change those (at bottom)

---

the program is an unoptimized piece of shit so disable the memory limit in opencomputers config.

in ur saves folder, find the correct filesystem and put in all the above files--replacing when necessary

(why is the screen fucked when setting the resolution without first using the startup script?)
