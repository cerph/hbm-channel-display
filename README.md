made for 1.12.2 extended ed. (1.7.10 uses a different api)

- realtime monitoring
- populates the channels at program startup
- i put in arbitrary values for the alerts, ur gonna want to change those (at bottom)

---

1. the program is *still* an unoptimized piece of shit so disable the memory limit in opencomputers config:

2. in ur saves folder, find the correct filesystem and put in all the above files--replacing when necessary
3. run channel_parameters, specify whether ur using reasim or not
4. done

(why is the screen fucked when setting the resolution without first using the startup script?)
