made for 1.12.2 (1.7.10 uses a different interface, gl)

- populates the channels at program startup
- ~2 second refresh delay
- made for reasim and won't work with a non-reasim boiler setup (easy to implement though)
- i put in arbitrary values for the alerts, ur gonna want to change those (at bottom)

and while ur here, do this so u can modify files out of game:

in ur saves folder, find the correct filesystem and put in all the above files--replacing when necessary

(if some1 can lmk why the screen is fucked when setting the resolution without first using the startup script)
