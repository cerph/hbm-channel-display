i made this in 1.12.2, and because 1.12.2 does not have an interface, here's mine (now merged with alcater's version):
https://github.com/cerph/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT/releases

- automatically populates/updates the channels at program startup
- ~3 second refresh delay
- made for reasim and i've never tested with a non-reasim boiler setup (it's very simple to make it work though)
- i put in arbitrary values for the alerts, ur gonna want to change those (at bottom)
